Miscellaneous improvements
--------------------------

* Deprecated methods display a warning message when they are still used (replaced DeprecationWarning by FutureWarning).
  Closes :issue:`310`.

* updated documentation of method `with_total` (closes :issue:`89`).

* trying to set values of a subset by passing an array with incompatible axes displays a better error message
  (closes :issue:`268`).

Fixes
-----

* fixed error raised in viewer when switching between arrays when a filter was set.

* fixed displaying empty array when starting the viewer or a new session in it.

* fixed the `view()`, `edit()` and `compare()` functions not being available in the viewer console.

* fixed row and column resizing by double clicking on the edge of an header cell.

* fixed `New` and `Open` in the menu `File` of the viewer when IPython console is not available.

* fixed getting a subset of an array by mixing boolean filters and other filters (closes :issue:`246`):

    >>> arr = ndrange('a=a0..a2;b=0..3')
    >>> arr
    a\b  0  1   2   3
     a0  0  1   2   3
     a1  4  5   6   7
     a2  8  9  10  11
    >>> arr['a0,a2', x.b < 2]
    a\b  0  1
     a0  0  1
     a2  8  9

  Warning: when mixed with other filters, boolean filters are limited to one dimension.

* fixed setting an array values using `array.points[key] = value` when value is an LArray (closes :issue:`368`).

* fixed using syntax 'int..int' in a selection (closes :issue:`350`):

    >>> arr = ndrange('a=2017..2012')
    >>> arr
    a  2017  2016  2015  2014  2013  2012
          0     1     2     3     4     5
    >>> arr['2012..2015']
    a  2012  2013  2014  2015
          5     4     3     2

* fixed mixing '..' sequences and spaces in an indexing string (closes :issue:`389`):

    >>> arr = ndtest(7)
    >>> arr
    a  a0  a1  a2  a3  a4  a5  a6
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    >>> arr['a0, a2, a4..a6']
    a  a0  a2  a4  a5  a6
        0   2   4   5   6

* fixed indexing/aggregating using groups with renaming (using >>) when the axis has mixed type labels (object dtype).
