Installation
============

Pre-built binaries
------------------

The easiest route to installing larray is through
`Conda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_.
For all platforms installing larray can be done with::

    conda install -c gdementen larray

This will install a lightweight version of larray
depending only on Numpy and Pandas libraries only.
Additional libraries are required to use the included
graphical user interface, make plots or use special
I/O functions for easy dump/load from Excel or
HDF files. Optional dependencies are described
below.

Installing larray with all optional dependencies
can be done with ::

    conda install -c gdementen larrayenv

You can also first add the channel `gdementen` to
your channel list ::

    conda config --add channels gdementen

and then install larray (or larrayenv) as ::

    conda install larray
