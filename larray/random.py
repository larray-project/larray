def randint(low, high=None, axes=None, dtype='l', meta=None):
    r"""Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).

    Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of the specified dtype in the "half-open" interval
    [`low`, `high`). If `high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : int
        Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless ``high=None``, in which case this parameter
        is one above the *highest* such integer).
    high : int, optional
        If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (see above for behavior
        if ``high=None``).
    axes : int, tuple of int, str, Axis or tuple/list/AxisCollection of Axis, optional
        Axes (or shape) of the resulting array. If ``axes`` is None (the default), a single value is returned.
        Otherwise, if the resulting axes have a shape of, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their name, i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder
        is not available and a specific precision may have different C types depending on the platform.
        The default value is 'np.int'.
    meta : list of pairs or dict or OrderedDict or Metadata, optional
        Metadata (title, description, author, creation_date, ...) associated with the array.
        Keys must be strings. Values must be of type string, int, float, date, time or datetime.

    Returns
    -------
    LArray

    Examples
    --------
    Generate a single int between 0 and 9, inclusive:

    >>> la.random.randint(10)                                   # doctest: +SKIP

    Generate an array of 10 ints between 1 and 5, inclusive:

def normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, axes=None, meta=None):
    r"""
    Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

    Its probability density function is often called the bell curve because of its characteristic shape (see the
    example below)

    Parameters
    ----------
    loc : float or array_like of floats
        Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
    scale : float or array_like of floats
        Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution.
    axes : int, tuple of int, str, Axis or tuple/list/AxisCollection of Axis, optional
        Minimum axes the resulting array must have. Defaults to None. The resulting array axes will be the union of
        those mentioned in ``axes`` and those of ``loc`` and ``scale``. If ``loc`` and ``scale`` are scalars and
        ``axes`` is None, a single value is returned. Otherwise, if the resulting axes have a shape of, e.g.,
        ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.
    meta : list of pairs or dict or OrderedDict or Metadata, optional
        Metadata (title, description, author, creation_date, ...) associated with the array.
        Keys must be strings. Values must be of type string, int, float, date, time or datetime.

    Returns
    -------
    LArray or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it describes the commonly occurring distribution of
    samples influenced by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own unique distribution [2]_.

    The probability density function for the Gaussian distribution, first derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by
    both Gauss and Laplace independently [2]_, is

    .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
                     e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },

    where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard deviation. The square of the standard deviation,
    :math:`\sigma^2`, is called the variance.

    The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with the standard deviation (the function reaches
    0.607 times its maximum at :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
    `la.random.normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to the mean, rather than those far away.

def uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, axes=None, meta=None):
    r"""
    Draw samples from a uniform distribution.

    Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).
    In other words, any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn by `uniform`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : float or array_like of floats, optional
        Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be greater than or equal to low.
        Defaults to 0.0.
    high : float or array_like of floats, optional
        Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be less than high.
        Defaults to 1.0.
    axes : int, tuple of int, str, Axis or tuple/list/AxisCollection of Axis, optional
        Minimum axes the resulting array must have. Defaults to None. The resulting array axes will be the union of
        those mentioned in ``axes`` and those of ``low`` and ``high``. If ``low`` and ``high`` are scalars and
        ``axes`` is None, a single value is returned. Otherwise, if the resulting axes have a shape of, e.g.,
        ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.
    meta : list of pairs or dict or OrderedDict or Metadata, optional
        Metadata (title, description, author, creation_date, ...) associated with the array.
        Keys must be strings. Values must be of type string, int, float, date, time or datetime.

    Returns
    -------
    LArray or scalar
        Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.

    --------
    randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function of the uniform distribution is

    .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}

    anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.

    When ``high`` == ``low``, values of ``low`` will be returned.
    If ``high`` < ``low``, the results are officially undefined and may eventually raise an error, i.e. do not rely on
    this function to behave when passed arguments satisfying that inequality condition.

    --------

    choices : 1-D array-like or int, optional
        Values to choose from.
        If an array, a random sample is generated from its elements.
        If an int n, the random sample is generated as if choices was la.sequence(n)
        If p is a 1-D LArray, choices are taken from its axis.
    axes : int, tuple of int, str, Axis or tuple/list/AxisCollection of Axis, optional
        Axes (or shape) of the resulting array. If ``axes`` is None (the default), a single value is returned.
        Otherwise, if the resulting axes have a shape of, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.
    replace : boolean, optional
        Whether the sample is with or without replacement.
    p : array-like, optional
        The probabilities associated with each entry in choices.
        If p is a 1-D LArray, choices are taken from its axis labels. If p is an N-D LArray, each cell represents the
        probability that the combination of labels will occur.
        If not given the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all entries in choices.

    >>> la.random.choice([5, 10, 15], p=[0.3, 0.5, 0.2], axes='a=a0,a1;b=b0..b2')       # doctest: +SKIP
    a\b  b0  b1  b2
     a0  15  10  10
     a1  10   5  10

    Same as above with labels and probabilities given as a one dimensional LArray

    >>> proba = LArray([0.3, 0.5, 0.2], Axis([5, 10, 15], 'outcome'))                   # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> proba                                                                           # doctest: +SKIP
    outcome    5   10   15
             0.3  0.5  0.2
    >>> choice(p=proba, axes='a=a0,a1;b=b0..b2')                                        # doctest: +SKIP
    a\b  b0  b1  b2
     a0  10  15   5
     a1  10   5  10

    Generate a uniform random sample of size 3 from la.sequence(5):

    >>> la.random.choice(5, 3)                                                          # doctest: +SKIP
    {0}*  0  1  2
          3  2  0
    >>> # This is equivalent to la.random.randint(0, 5, 3)

    Generate a non-uniform random sample of size 3 from the given choices without replacement:

    >>> la.random.choice(['hello', 'world', '!'], 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0.6, 0.3])  # doctest: +SKIP
    {0}*      0  1      2
          world  !  hello

    Using an N-dimensional array as probabilities:

    >>> proba = LArray([[0.15, 0.25, 0.10],
    ...                 [0.20, 0.10, 0.20]], 'a=a0,a1;b=b0..b2')                        # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> proba                                                                           # doctest: +SKIP
    a\b    b0    b1   b2
     a0  0.15  0.25  0.1
     a1   0.2   0.1  0.2
    >>> choice(p=proba, axes='draw=d0..d5')                                             # doctest: +SKIP
